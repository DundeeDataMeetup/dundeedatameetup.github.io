      title: Exploring Open Data Scotland and Example Projects
      description: Open Data Scotland is an open-source, collaborative, and volunteer run project which helps people locate and understand Open Data in Scotland better. The project which emerged from a weekend hack event at Code The City 23 has now been in operation for over 2 years and involves pulling data from various data sources; cleaning, processing and collating the data into a standardised store; then publishing the data to an interactive frontend, along with hosted data visualisations. All of this is to help the public understand what Open Data is available in Scotland.
