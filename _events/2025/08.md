      title: "Wikidata - its place in the Open Data eco-system"
      description: |
        Wikidata is a collaboratively edited multilingual knowledge graph hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. It is a common source of open data that Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia, and anyone else, are able to use under the CC0 public domain license. As of early-2025, Wikidata had 1.65 billion item statements (semantic triples). Its open nature means that anyone can contribute data to it, and its powerful SPARQL interface permits sophisticated querying.

        In this talk, Ian will give an overview of Wikidata, examine use cases for it, identify some associated tools, and finish with practical SPARQL querying examples to help you get started in re-using data from the system.

      title: "OpenStreetMap: what, why, and how's it doing?"
      description: |
        A world wide wiki map, the leading open geospatial database, an unstoppable community project, a life-saver for humanitarian projects, a source of art, a global industry disruptor, and much more. You might know OpenStreetMap, but how well do you really know it?

        Let's also look at why you should care about it, why you should use it, and why millions of people have built the data. Not to mention how good and strong the project and the data is now. This will be a wide-breadth talk covering the many subject interests of OpenStreetMap. No technical knowledge required, but there will be pointers to where you can find out more.
