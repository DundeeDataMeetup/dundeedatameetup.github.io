      description: "**How would you like to see an actual, quantum computer, actually working?**


        Everyone's heard about quantum computers - how they'll be able to solve every computational problem in the blink of an eye, decrypting every coded message, and spilling our secrets across the internet. That’s if they ever get delivered: for all the talk, nobody seems able to construct a working quantum computer. So is the whole idea nothing more than fairy dust?



        Actually, quantum computers do exist, and we can use them to run real algorithms. Within a few years, quantum computers are going to be a useful part of the programmer’s armoury, routinely solving problems in optimisation, recognition, machine learning, and simulation that no other technology can handle. This session explains what a quantum computer is, why it is so different from a conventional computer, and how we design quantum algorithms. Finally, it will show a simple, “Hello, Quantum World” program running on real quantum hardware."
