      description: |
        Archaeology Scotland and Amina Moti have been working on a DigiTay funded community archaeology and digital skills project in Dundee using an archaeological survey project as a vehicle to deliver digital skills training to marginalized and displaced groups in Dundee. This demographic face a variety of barriers in receiving digital skills training and on their employability journey and in engaging with cultural heritage. This project sought to bring together the benefits an archaeology project to provide a safe and positive space for the group to learn and develop digital skills, language skills and other transferable skills. This talk will reflect on our experiences delivering the project and where we see it could develop in the future.
