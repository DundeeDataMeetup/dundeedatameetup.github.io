        Speed DATAing is a fast-paced, friendly networking event designed to kick off the year by connecting people who share a passion for data 📊✨

        Whether you’re a student, early-career professional, career-switcher, or an experienced data practitioner, this event is all about meaningful connections—quickly. Through a series of short, structured conversations, you’ll meet others who are exploring data science, analytics, engineering, AI, and related fields 🤝

        This isn’t just networking for networking’s sake. Speed DATAing focuses on three things:

        🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Community: Meet like-minded people who are learning, building, and working in data
        💼 Employability: Share and receive support around internships, job searching, CV reviews, portfolios, interviews, and career direction
        🧠 Mentorship: Connect with people who are happy to listen, offer guidance, and share real-world experience
        Come to grow your network, get unstuck, offer help, or simply meet people who “get” your interest in data 🚀 You’ll leave with new contacts, fresh perspectives, and hopefully a few future collaborators or mentors.

        No pressure. No awkward small talk. Just meaningful conversations—at speed ⚡
