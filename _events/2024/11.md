      title: "Sensitive Data and Open Science"
      description: "\"Open Science\" is the idea that scientific research should be accessible to everyone. This is a bit trickier when it comes to sensitive data, such as healthcare data. Simon will be talking about the \"Trusted Research Environment\" run by Dundee that allows researchers to analyse sensitive data, whilst minimising the risk of that data being leaked."
